# Dengue_fever

It is a vector-borne disease caused by dengue virus. It is transmitted to humans following a bite by an infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary causative agent and Aede albopitcus, other secondary vectors. The mosquito vectors are also known to spread Zika, Chikungunya and Fellow fever diseases.
Dengue fever can be categorised into with/without warning signs and severe dengue first reported in 1950, Philipines, Thailand. 
About 400 million peole are infected with dengue virus every year causing an approximated 22000 deaths according to [Sudipta et al](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjm-2020-0572).     

## Dengue virus

It is a single strand RNA enveloped virus of the family Flaviviridae that causes visceral and nervous system ilnesses in humans. There are four antigenically distinct serotypes of the virus, DENV1-4, all capable of causing severe dengue, named do due to the differences in the interaction with the human host blood serum. An individual therefore is at risk of dengue infection to a maximum of four times, since cross immunity protection from one type followed by prior exposure by another lasts 3 months at most as inferrenced by [nature science](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dengue-viruses-22400925/).    

### Dengue virus structure

It is a spherical 50 nm virion comprised of three structural proteins (capsid (C), pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M)), and envelope (E)), a lipid envelope, and a 10.7 kilobase capped RNA. The E protein is a class II viral membrane fusion protein that has an elongated three-domain (domains (D) Iâ€“III) structure; it directs several critical steps of the viral replication cycle including engagement with cellular attachment and entry factors, membrane fusion, and virion assembly.

DENV binds to target cells via a structurally diverse group of attachment factors, including glycosaminoglycans (heparan sulfate), C-type lectins (DC-SIGN (CD209) and the mannose receptor (CD206)), and immunomodulatory proteins (TIM/TAM receptors).    

The core of the virus is the nucleocapsid, a structure that is made of the viral genome along with C proteins. The nucleocapsid is surrounded by a membrane called the viral envelope, a lipid bilayer that is taken from the host. Embedded in the viral envelope are 180 copies of the E and M proteins that span through the lipid bilayer. These proteins form a protective outer layer that controls the entry of the virus into human cells.        
    

### Replication
This pouch is called an endosome. A cell normally uses endosomes to take in large molecules and particles from outside the cell for nourishment. By hijacking this normal cell process, the dengue virus is able to enter a host cell.

Similarly, internalization of bound virions is mediated primarily by clathrin and is followed by the trafficking of virus particles to the acidified late endosome where structural rearrangements of the E protein promote fusion of viral and host membranes. After nucleocapsid penetration into the cytoplasm, the viral genomic RNA is translated into a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into three structural and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) by viral (NS3) and as yet undetermined host proteases. Negative-strand viral RNA is synthesized and directs positive-strand RNA synthesis in association with a virus-induced network of membranes. Positive-strand RNA is packaged in progeny virions, which bud into the ER to form enveloped immature virions. The conformation and organization of E on the virion change considerably during virion assembly and release (Figure 1). The E proteins of newly synthesized immature virions exist as dimers with prM and are incorporated into the virion as heterotrimeric spikes that project off its surface. Virion maturation occurs through the actions of furin proteases in the trans-Golgi network during viral egress, and virion secretion into the extracellular space occurs by exocytosis. On mature virions, E proteins lie relatively flat against the virus membrane in a pseudo-icosahedral pattern, resulting in a relatively smooth appearance according to
